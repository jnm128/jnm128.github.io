<p>The <strong>Commodore 64</strong>, also known as the C64 or the CBM 64, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. 
 It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, 
with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units.</p>

<p>Part of the <strong>Commodore 64</strong>'s success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores. 
Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs,
including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology.</p>

 <p>Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles have been made for the <strong>Commodore 64</strong> including development tools,
office productivity applications, and video games.</p>
